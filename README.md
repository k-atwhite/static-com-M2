# Static Composition
Module 2 Front End
HTMP + CSS Project

## Specifications
The static comp challenge is designed to get comfortable with more complex styling in CSS and HTML. I recreated a webpage based off of a provided static comp. I was not provided with any assets or native files and sourced everything on my own. I planned this composition first with mobile ussers in mind  - consdiering layout acorss various screen sizes.

My personal goal is to spend time researching good design practices as well as accessibilty practices. I was suprised to find that the "rules" of design and accessibility are nor fully centralized, and that much of web design is totally subjective! It's more of the wild west than I anticipated.


## Design Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Layout and design that adapts to users platform, screen size, and orientation

- **User Experience**: Users can navigate the website intuitively.

- **Fonts**: Serif fonts are always reserved for headlines, because at smaller sizes they become hard to read. Body text should generally be sans-serif. To reduce clutter, keep the number of different fonts on a website to a minimum. Two or three at the most. Some font files can be pretty enormous, and this could potentially slow the load time of a website.

- **Colors**: Keep your color palette minimal, just stick to 2 or 3. They should of course echo the host’s branding, while serving to highlight important areas.

- **Images**: Keep movement minimal. In general, studies show that viewers much prefer websites that keep still. Always abide by all stock image licensing restrictions and be aware of the licensing restrictions associated with your images. Make sure your image sizes are as low as possible (web resolution is 72 ppi). Images often account for 60% or more of a web page’s size/loading time.

- **Visual hierarchy**:  The orderly arrangement of elements, according to their importance. Done poorly, users could be bombarded by the different features of your designs all fighting to get their attention. 




## Accessibility Considerations
- **Contrast Ratio**: Some people with visual impairments may find it difficult to read text without high contrast against the background, whether a plain background or text embedded within an image. WCAG 2.0 requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.


- **Don’t Rely on Color**: Color alone does not provide enough information to be considered accessible web design. Go beyond color and use accessible design tactics to identify website elements and help all your users.


- **Label Forms Clearly**: Provide descriptive labels for all form fields. There may be a temptation to place the label words inside the form field. Resist. Screen readers may miss these labels.


- **No Mouse, No Problem**: Using the keyboard tab key, users must quickly recognize which link is active, and what is happening with the link.


- **Keep Navigation Consistent**:  Provide web users with consistent navigation, such as site search and site maps, making sure that your labels, styles, and positions are consistent


- **Simple Headings and Spacing**: Expert use of heading styles, white space and placement of elements reduces clutter, making content more accessible


- **Design for Different Devices, Views, and Screens**: For mobile and other narrow views, structure primary content in one or two columns, and offer secondary content through icons and links.
