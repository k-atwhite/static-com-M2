# Static Composition
Module 2 Front End
HTMP + CSS Project

## Specifications
The static comp challenge is designed to get comfortable with more complex styling in CSS and HTML. I recreated a webpage based off of a provided static comp. I was not provided with any assets or native files and sourced everything on my own. I planned this composition first with mobile ussers in mind  - consdiering layout acorss various screen sizes.
